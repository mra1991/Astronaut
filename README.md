# Astronaut
 
 This Unity C# project is a 2D platformer game called "Astronaut." 
 Players take on the role of an astronaut and must push a large crystal to the end of each level, 
 solving puzzles along the way by pushing stone blocks to create a path. 
 Collecting gems throughout the level will increase the player's score. 
 The astronaut can jump and activate a thrust ability while in the air 
 by holding down the jump button for up to 1 second. Thrust can only be used once per jump. 
 Players can choose to play using either a keyboard or gamepad.
